  "Young researchers often have difficulty in balancing the implementation of their own ideas and updating the knowledge of their field. As newbies in our field,  we quite often get lost in endless sea of  literature. Every day newly published papers flood in, each claiming a promising disease target or a potential therapy. <b>But how many of them are truly important ?</b><br>Very few. <br>Due to the extreme complexity of life, unfortunately, a conclusion that holds solid in cell experiments might not be applicable in vivo or to other cell types; a therapy turned successful in one species is likely to fail  in treating  a closely related species (e.g. mice and rats). But that's not to say we should unfollow the topic or unsubscribe journals. Literature is necessary to keep us updated with latest research articles. <br>Then, with very limited time we have as PhD trainees, how can we distinguish the milestone work from mediocre ones, and find the worthwhile piece of work to read? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-This is where data analytics come to rescue. <br>I shall share my own experience of using data analytics to find impactful research articles and form ideas of <b>Alzheimer's Disease(AD)</b>.",
  " To begin with, I downloaded and processed all clinical articles published in last 4 decades on Alzheimer's Disease from PubMed. I am especially interested in clinical trials since they are most likely to produce treatments and cures in future. (Strongly recommend <b>PubMed</b> here. It is a great scource of data on life sciences which is open access to everyone and it even has a set of tools, <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25500/'>E-utilities</a>, to help users export data.)<br> In 2015, 46.8 million  people are diagnosed as AD patients, and this number is likely to double in 20 years. Thus the explosion of articles in this field is not a surprise to me.Interestingly, the clinical articles remain relatively constant since 1997. A likely guess is more and more small groups have become interested in AD and joined in, but most of them contribute only non-clinical research articles as the cost of clinical research is too enormous to afford.",
  "Top 10 journals are picked up based on how many clinical trials on AD are published on them. A scatter plot is then created based on impact factor (found online) and calculated average citations per paper of each journal. (Notably, only citations from PubMed searchable papers are counted, which underestimates the actual number, but this effect should not alter our conclusion.)<br>The 10 journals  take up almost half of the total citations of the 644 journals involved. An interesting finding is the positive corelation between ranking of total AD clinical papers and impact factor of the journal, such as <i>Neurology</i>, the journal with most AD clinical trials published, is also the most impactful one. This indicates AD clinical trials are more likely to attract citations than others.",
  "A simple sorting of these papers by citation numbers gives nice representation of milestone research. For example the most cited paper by <b>Rondolph C et al</b>,<i>The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS): preliminary clinical validity.</i>, is a landmark research published in 1998 in designing a test instrument, RBANS , which can effectively detect and characterize dementia of different etiologies. <br>By reading through their abstracts of the most cited papers in chronological order, we can soon draw a path about how the topic was developed in the past half century. ",
  "Most of the time we care more about lastest important progress than classical but outdated ones. While old papers tend to outcompete new ones on citations due to natural priviledge. To select only lastest findings, we can simply apply a filter on the publish date. Then sort again by citations. And the produced results are pretty informative. <br>For example, the top 2 most cited papers, (<b>Doody RS et al</b>)<i>Phase 3 trials of solanezumab for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.</i> sponsored by pharmaceutical companies Eli Lily and  (<b>Salloway S et al</b>)<i>Two phase 3 trials of bapineuzumab in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.</i>  They are very meaningful work marking the failure of amyloid hypotheis, the most popular theory on explaining pathology of AD in last decade. \
<br>\
<br> <b>Amyloid Hypothesis</b> \
<br>The theory  postulated that extracellular amyloid beta (AÎ²) deposits are the fundamental cause of the disease, which leads to a tempting speculation : targeted clearance of pathological deposits might stop or even cure alzheimer's disease. However, despite the effectiveness in deposit clearance, these antibodies turned to be bitter disappointment in failing to improve cognition or functional ability.   \
<br>\
<br> <b>New Trends</b> \
<br>The top 5 cited paper, 'Intranasal insulin therapy for Alzheimer disease and amnestic mild cognitive impairment: a pilot clinical trial.' , is the signal of one of the new trends, insulin therapy. In the beginning of 21 century, Intranasal insulin began attracting attention  small human studies reported improved cognition without a change in blood glucose or insulin levels in healthy volunteers. Later on some researchers found significant relevance between diabetes and AD, suggesting the relationship between AD and metabolism. \
<br>Although implausible, this theory is gaining popularity among scientists now. However it is unclear whether insulin therapy would perform well in longer trials. A new study on insulin therapy has been recruiting researchers since December 2016(NCT01767909). ",
  "Using Alzheimer's Disease(AD) as example, I shared my experience on how public accessible data  can be used in identifying trend, extracting important information, and spotting great research. Comparing with doing it manually,  it picks up important work without bias from individual researcher, and more importantly, saves great amount of time for graduate students who are keen to learn the environment of his/her research.<br><br><b>References:</b><br>1.
